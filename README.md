# Hand-Written-Character-Recognition-Tamil-HWCR
As the title reads, this repository contains the necessary files to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model, to predict Single Character Digitally Hand-written tamil characters. The data set contains over 79,000 images with multiple handwriting scripts and styles from different users. The dataset upload is processed and already classfied into 162 character labels with an additional 'Labels' file that is the reference label image for the predicted character class.

Steps to Follow:
   1. Download the dataset for the 162 Tamil Character Labels from this link here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cFxDzl3VTXRLwt7vJckljgz1orixwZci/view?usp=sharing          and store them in your required directory.
  2. Install Tensorflow and Keras (if not already available) in your Python interpretor application. The attached code was run using Jupyter Notebook, powered by the           Anaconda distributor.
  3. Download the repository and run the cells in your studio, replacing the '...' with your directory names.
  4. The Structure of the currently built CNN model is attached in the files. You can explore more on the Deep Learning Technique and try to make it your own! using this       reference - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn
